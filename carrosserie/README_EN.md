# 🛠️ Carrosserie – Montage et Fixation

## FOREWORD

![Tools](./images/tools.png)

Before diving into the wonderful world of custom-printed car bodies, let’s be clear: between printing time, painting (you're on your own here, Picasso), assembly, and all the fiddly adjustments that would make a Swiss watchmaker cry, expect to spend around 100 hours. Yep. One hundred. During that time, your beautiful 4x4 will be completely out of service—naked and sad, with nothing on its chassis.

You’ll need:
- A 3 mm metric screw kit (I got a 1000-piece one, because why not go overkill?).

- Threaded inserts for 3 mm screws.

- A small soldering iron to install those inserts properly (not your wire-soldering one, a real precision iron).

- And above all: a lot of clutter around your workspace. If it’s too clean, it doesn’t feel like a real maker zone. Chaos is fuel.
