# 🚗 TRX4 Sport Hummer Project – Full Upgrade & Documentation

> 🇫🇷 [Voir la version française](./README.md)

This is a full upgrade project for the **Traxxas TRX4 Sport 1/10**, originally based on a few things published on Thingiverse, but entirely restructured, cleaned up, and enhanced.  
The goal is to deliver a **clean, solid build** with a **Hummer-style body shell** that fits in place without modifying original Traxxas parts.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a **realistic body** that installs just like an official Traxxas shell
- Add **custom lighting management** and usability/storage tweaks
- Maintain **maximum compatibility** with original options (2-speed, diff lockers…)
- Avoid destructive mods – ideal for keeping warranty and reusability

---

## 🔧 Tools and workflow

All parts, code, models and diagrams are made by hand — be kind, it's a lot of work!

- 🧩 **3D modeling**: [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360)
- 🔌 **Electronics**: Schematics via [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)
- 💡 **Firmware**: Programmed using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- 🖨️ **Fabrication**:
  - 0.8mm nozzle 3D printer (for strength)
  - Printed in **PETG**
  - Basic soldering tools and common components

Each section (body, electronics, firmware…) has its own files, images, and detailed instructions.

## 🧠 Who is it for?

This project is **open to all** and split into modules so you can reuse only what you need.  
The idea is to make it **as beginner-friendly as possible**, even if some approaches are kept simple on purpose.

🙏 Please be indulgent: some decisions favor simplicity over engineering perfection.

## 🚀 Evolution & Future

- ✅ A basic telemetry system is already implemented
- 🛰️ A GPS blackbox is being considered, depending on microcontroller limits
- 🧪 Feedback and help are welcome — especially around telemetry!

## ☕ Support the project?

This has taken a **lot of time and energy** (design, test, document…).  
I’m not trying to buy a villa in the Bahamas 😄 — but if this helped you and you'd like to give back...

🎁 **A small donation would help me buy 2 PETG spools, some screws or heat inserts!**
